# Title

In github, branches are a way to isolate new changes from your project until they are ready to be included. Branches allow you to safely try new things without worrying about negatively affecting your project. Should you write yourself into a dead end, or accidently mess up the formatting of a document beyond easy repair, you can simply discard the branch and try again.

### More detail 

If there are concepts that should be described separately, they might belong in a subparagraph section like this one.
